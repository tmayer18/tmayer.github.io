Jellyfish are one of the most efficient swimmers in the sea, and replicating their high efficiency in robotic systems would be particularly helpful for long-duration underwater missions where battery life is prioritized over speed. In CMUs Bioinspired Robot Design and Experimentation course, my team of three designed and tested a jellyfish robot and compared its operation to more conventional propeller thrust designs

In order to directly compare these two vastly different methods of locomotion, we designed a novel jellyfish actuator that operated off a single brushless motor. This approach, which differs from most other robotic jellyfish, let us use the same actuator for two vastly different locomotion modes and eliminated the need for estimates of motor efficiency or complex motor dynamics calculations. 

Throughout this project, we focused on taking inspiration from real world biology for building robotic systems. We also undertook the opposite problem, using robotic systems to better study biology in more humane and controlled environments. We utilized the scientific method from start to finish, developing a well rounded research question and hypothesis, developing an experimental platform, and running experiments to attempt to answer the question.
