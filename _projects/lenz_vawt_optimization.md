Vertical Axis Wind Turbines are a promising renewable energy technology due to their manufacturing and maintainence simplicity, and their ability to operate in turbulent and omnidirectonal wind conditions. However, most traditional VAWT designs generate significantly less power than their more common horizontal axis cousins. For my undergraduate capstone design course at Trine University, my team and I worked to use computational fluid dynamics and evolutionary algorithms to iteratively optimize a LENZ-inspired vertical axis wind turbine blade design for power efficiency and ease of startup. 

This project heavily used ANSYS Fluent fluids simulation suite to simulate the unsteady effects of the turbine blades rotate over time, calculating the complex wake effects that are the primary influence on turbine performance. In addition to simulation, we also validated our results experimentally using 3d printed turbine models tested in a wind tunnel. With these two analysis tools, I developed an evolutionary algorithm to generate hundreds of design variations and evaluate them in simulation, which over time began producing better and better turbine designs. 

By the end of the 8 month long project, we had tested over 150 different designs and found a turbine which boasted efficiency on-par with the state-of-the-art in VAWT research, but also with garunteed startup behavior.

As a part of this project, we published a paper in the AIAA Student Paper Conference (name) and presented at...
