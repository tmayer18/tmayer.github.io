Cubesats, small basketball sized satellites, are rapidly bringing the cost and barrier-to-entry of orbital experiments down. Because of this, new solutions are needed for conventional mission architecture tasks like orbit determinination and data transmission limitations. The Argus mission being developed and launched by CMU's Spacecraft Design-Build-Fly aims to showcase an onboard compute vision-based solution to these problems.

As a part of the Argus mission's Comm/Ops team, I worked to design, evaluate and prototype the cubesat's antenna, and to construct the ground-station for the data communication. One of the tasks I was responsible for was link-budget calculations, modelling the radio signals decay through the atmosphere and ensuring that the transmit power and recieve sensitivity was enough to ensure reliable communication. I also worked on the design and construction of the ground-station that will send commands and recieve data from the satellite in orbit. 

During this project, we will be carrying out "ridge-test" experiments to verify the feasability of our antenna and ground station. By transmitting between two tall hills, the connection capability of the actual satellite in orbit can be modelled and evaluated. This will be necessary before the launch of the satellite in fall of 2024.
